# 🧠 Technical Skills

A snapshot of tools, frameworks, and platforms I’ve used extensively in automation, DevOps, API testing, and quality engineering.

## 🧪 Automation Frameworks & Tools

- ✅ **Karate DSL** – Full-featured BDD API framework (REST, SOAP, GraphQL, Mocking)
- ✅ **Cypress** – Modern frontend E2E testing with network control
- ✅ **Selenium WebDriver** – Legacy and browser compatibility testing
- ✅ **Cucumber / Gherkin** – BDD-style DSL for feature documentation
- ✅ **Postman + Newman** – Manual and CLI-based test executions
- ✅ **ReadyAPI + SoapUI** – Legacy XML / SOAP API testing
- ✅ **Pact** – Consumer-driven contract testing
- ✅ **Allure / Extent Reports** – Visual test reporting

## 💻 Programming & Scripting

- ☕ **Java** – Core, OOP, Streams, Lambdas (8+ years)
- 🐍 **Python** – Automation scripting, REST clients
- 📜 **JavaScript / TypeScript** – UI automation (Cypress), mocking
- ⚙️ **Groovy / Shell** – Scripting for Jenkins, test runners

---

## 🚀 CI/CD & DevOps

- 🔄 **Jenkins** – Pipelines, nightly jobs, test stage integrations
- 🐳 **Docker** – Containerized automation executions

- 🎯 **GCP** – Cloud Run, Pub/Sub for event stream testing

---

## 🛠 Event & Messaging Systems

- 📬 **Kafka** – Event stream validation, consumer group testing
- 🔁 **Avro / Schema Registry** – Payload validation for Kafka topics
- 🧵 **Async Retry + Polling** – Custom polling and replay logic

---

## 🔐 Security & Authorization

- 🔐 **OAuth2.0** – Token-based flows with refresh logic
- 🪪 **JWT** – Claims-based verification and dynamic injection
- 🧩 **API Keys, HMAC** – Header-level auth in regression suites

---

## 📚 Test Management & Reporting

- 🧾 **Allure**, **ExtentReports**, **Karate HTML Reports**
- 🗂️ **Zephyr**, **Xray**, **TestRail** (integration-ready)
